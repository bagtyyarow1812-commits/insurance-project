            <h3 id="11">1.1 Ancient origins of insurance</h3>
            <p>Ancient forms of insurance represent the first attempts of society to protect itself from risks and uncertainties. These forms were simple and often based on mutual aid and collective responsibility. This section examines some of the ancient forms of insurance that laid the foundation for the modern insurance system.</p>
            <p><strong>Mentions of ancient forms of insurance</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Talmud:</strong> The ancient Talmud contains rules that can be considered the first forms of insurance (Figure 1). For example, the Talmud describes rules according to which a shipowner is liable for damage caused to other vessels or cargo.</li>
                <li><strong>The Ordinance of the Island of Rhodes:</strong> This document, dating back to the 7th century BC, contains rules regulating marine insurance. The ordinance provided compensation for lost or damaged goods, which is one of the first examples of insurance.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Significance of ancient forms of insurance</strong></p>
            <p>Ancient forms of insurance were important steps towards the creation of the modern insurance system. They show how societies have long sought to protect themselves from risks and ensure financial stability. These first steps in insurance laid the foundation for the more complex and diverse insurance products we see today.</p>

            <h3 id="12">1.2 18th century: The beginning of insurance in Russia</h3>
            <p>The 18th century was an important stage in the development of the insurance system in Russia. During this period, the first steps were taken towards creating an organized insurance infrastructure.</p>
            <p><strong>Creation of the Insurance Expedition under Catherine II</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Catherine II's initiative:</strong> In 1780, on the initiative of Catherine II, the Insurance Expedition was established. It was the first state institution engaged in insurance in Russia. The main goal of the expedition was to provide insurance for state needs and support trade.</li>
                <li><strong>Functions of the Insurance Expedition:</strong> The expedition insured ships and cargo, which was especially important for the development of maritime trade. It also provided insurance services for government institutions and private individuals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Abolition of the Insurance Expedition</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reasons for abolition:</strong> Despite the importance of the Insurance Expedition, it was abolished in 1797. The main reasons were financial difficulties and a lack of efficiency in managing insurance operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on the development of the insurance market:</strong> The abolition of the Insurance Expedition did not stop the development of insurance in Russia. In subsequent years, new attempts were made to create insurance institutions, which ultimately led to the formation of a more sustainable insurance system.</li>
            </ul>
