            <h2>Chapter 2. Insurance in the 20th century</h2>

            <h3 id="21">2.1 Revolution and state monopoly</h3>
            <p>The 20th century was a period of significant changes in the Russian insurance system. After the October Revolution of 1917, radical transformations took place that deeply affected the insurance market.</p>
            <p><strong>Transformations after the October Revolution</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nationalization of insurance companies:</strong> After the October Revolution, all insurance companies were nationalized. This meant that insurance became a state monopoly, and all insurance operations were under state control.</li>
                <li><strong>Creation of Gosstrakh:</strong> In 1921, Gosstrakh was created, which became the main insurance institution in the Soviet Union. Gosstrakh handled all types of insurance, including property, transport and life insurance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Impact of the state monopoly on the insurance market</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Centralization of insurance services:</strong> The state monopoly led to the centralization of insurance services. All insurance operations were concentrated in the hands of the state, which made it possible to more effectively manage risks and allocate resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Unification of insurance products:</strong> Under monopoly conditions, insurance products were unified, which simplified the insurance process and made it more accessible to a wide audience.</li>
                <li><strong>Restriction of private insurance:</strong> During the state monopoly, private insurance was practically impossible. This limited competition and innovation in the insurance market.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="22">2.2 Soviet period</h3>
            <p>The Soviet period in the history of insurance in Russia is characterized by the development of state insurance and its integration into the country's economic system.</p>
            <p><strong>Development of state insurance in the USSR</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creation of Gosstrakh:</strong> In 1921, Gosstrakh was established, becoming the main insurance institution in the Soviet Union. Gosstrakh handled all types of insurance, including property, transport and life insurance.</li>
                <li><strong>State management of insurance:</strong> All insurance operations were under state control. This made it possible to manage risks more effectively and allocate resources in accordance with state priorities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The role of state insurance in the economy</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Financial support for the state:</strong> Gosstrakh provided financial support to the state by insuring state facilities and infrastructure. This helped minimize financial losses from natural disasters and other risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Social protection of the population:</strong> Gosstrakh also provided social protection to the population by offering insurance services to citizens. This included life and health insurance, which was important for maintaining social stability.</li>
                <li><strong>Unification of insurance products:</strong> Under the state monopoly, insurance products were unified, which simplified the insurance process and made it more accessible to a wide audience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="23">2.3 Transition period and modernity</h3>
            <p>The transition period at the end of the 20th century was an important stage in the development of the insurance system in Russia. During this period, significant changes took place related to demonopolization and denationalization of the insurance market.</p>
            <p><strong>Demonopolization and denationalization of the insurance market</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Abolition of the state monopoly:</strong> At the end of the 20th century, the state monopoly on insurance was abolished, allowing private companies to enter the insurance market. This led to increased competition and diversity of insurance products.</li>
                <li><strong>Creation of new insurance companies:</strong> After the abolition of the monopoly, many new insurance companies were created in Russia, offering a wide range of insurance services. This included life, property, transport insurance and other types.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Impact of changes on the insurance market</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased competition:</strong> The introduction of private insurance companies significantly increased the level of competition in the insurance market. This forced companies to offer better services and innovative products.</li>
                <li><strong>Development of insurance technologies:</strong> In a competitive environment, insurance companies began to actively introduce new technologies and risk management methods. This included the use of computer systems for data processing and policy management.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved customer service:</strong> Competition also led to improved customer service. Insurance companies began to pay more attention to customer satisfaction and providing individual insurance solutions.</li>
            </ul>
