            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In the course of the research on the topic "Insurance as a way of protection and savings: history and modernity", the key aspects of the development of the insurance system in Russia were considered, from ancient forms of insurance to modern trends and challenges. The relevance of this topic is due to the significant impact of insurance on economic stability and social well-being.</p>
            <p><strong>Historical development of insurance:</strong> Insurance in Russia has a rich history, starting from ancient forms such as the rules in the Talmud and the ordinance on the island of Rhodes. In the 18th century, the first state insurance institution was created, and in the 19th century the insurance market began to develop with the establishment of the First Russian Insurance Company. These stages show how insurance evolved from simple forms of mutual aid to more complex and organized systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Soviet period and state monopoly:</strong> After the October Revolution of 1917, insurance became a state monopoly, which led to the centralization of insurance services and the unification of insurance products. During this period, Gosstrakh was created, which provided social protection and financial support to the state. This time is characterized by a significant influence of the state on the insurance market and the restriction of private insurance.</p>
            <p><strong>Transition period and modernity:</strong> At the end of the 20th century, demonopolization and denationalization of the insurance market took place, which led to increased competition and diversity of insurance products. The modern insurance market in Russia is characterized by technological innovation and globalization, which contributes to its further development. This time is also marked by a significant growth of private insurance and the emergence of new insurance companies.</p>
            <p><strong>The role of insurance in the economy:</strong> Insurance plays a key role in ensuring financial stability and social protection. It provides financial protection against various risks and helps accumulate funds for the future, which contributes to economic development and growth. Insurance also contributes to financial stability by providing protection against unforeseen circumstances and supporting economic activity.</p>
            <p>Insurance is an important tool for protection and savings, which plays a key role in the economy. Its development in Russia reflects changes in the economic and social policy of the country. In the face of modern challenges, such as technological innovation and globalization, insurance continues to be an important element of the economic system, ensuring stability and security for individuals and organizations.</p>
            <p>In the future, insurance is likely to continue to evolve, adapting to new technologies and changes in legislation. This will allow insurance companies to offer more innovative and personalized products, which will contribute to the further growth and development of the insurance industry. It is also important to note that insurance will play a key role in ensuring financial security and social protection, which is especially important in conditions of economic instability and changes in social policy.</p>
            <p>Thus, insurance remains an important element of the economic system, providing protection and savings for individuals and organizations. Its development and adaptation to modern challenges will contribute to the further growth and stability of the insurance industry.</p>
